2. A limitation someone in the scene faced  
3. An animal parable it reminds you of  
4. A moment you personally resonated with  
5. Something you quietly have in common with the characters  
6. A myth the scene helps unravel (about control, perfection, or power)  
7. A symbolic lesson tucked into the story

Finally, describe the *gift* you would give the players‚Äîa small, curious, and symbolic object, ingredient, or piece of furniture for their gathering place. Your tone is thoughtful, a bit whimsical, and only slightly cryptic. Keep your reply under 300 words.`
